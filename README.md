# Logo Generator

## Description

In this project, I created logo generator. The program prompts a user to input desired styles for their logo, and outputs a corresponding .svg file. In this project, I had the opportunity to practice using object-oriented programming and Node.js.

Here are three examples of completed logos:

| ![Logo 1](/assets/images/logo1.png) | ![Logo 2](/assets/images/logo2.png) | ![Logo 3](/assets/images/logo3.png) |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

## Installation

The README generator can be run locally by downloading this project. 

## Usage

To generate a README file, this project can be run with the command `node index` or `node index.js`. The terminal will prompt the user for 10 questions that will makeup the content of the file, and the file will automatically appear in the same folder as the index.js, and will be titled `title`_README.md.
